### Learning Goals:

The goals of this project were to create a functional web application that enable users to make and save Romcom covers. We worked with Visiual studio, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Github.

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins - making the pages change and buttons work and using a rondomizer was very interesting and opens new doors to future projects.

Challenges - saving the covers, merging on github were all challenges we faced. we overcame these challenges by utilizing our notes and using google and mozilla documents and our internal networks.
